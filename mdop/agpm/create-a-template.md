# Create a Template


Creating a template enables you to save all of the settings of a particular version of a Group Policy object (GPO) to use as a starting point for creating new GPOs.

**Note**  
A template is an uneditable, static version of a GPO for use as a starting point for creating new, editable GPOs.

 

A user account with the Editor or AGPM Administrator (Full Control) role or necessary permissions in Advanced Group Policy Management is required to complete this procedure. Review the details in "Additional considerations" in this topic.

**To create a template based on an existing GPO**

1.  In the **Group Policy Management Console** tree, click **Change Control** in the forest and domain in which you want to manage GPOs.

2.  On the **Contents** tab in the details pane, click the **Controlled** or **Uncontrolled** tab to display available GPOs.

3.  Right-click the GPO from which you want to create a template, then click **Save as Template**.
