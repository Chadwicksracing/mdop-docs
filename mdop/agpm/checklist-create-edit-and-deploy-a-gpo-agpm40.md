# Checklist: Create, Edit, and Deploy a GPO


In an environment where multiple people change Group Policy Objects (GPOs) by using Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM), an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) delegates permission to Editors, Approvers, and Reviewers either as groups or as individuals. The following is a typical GPO development process for an Editor and an Approver.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Task</th>
<th align="left">Reference</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>Editor requests that a new GPO be created or an Approver creates a new GPO.</p></td>
