# Checklist: Create, Edit, and Deploy a GPO


In an environment where multiple people make changes to Group Policy objects (GPOs), an AGPM Administrator (Full Control) delegates permission to Editors, Approvers, and Reviewers, either as groups or as individuals. The following is a typical GPO development process for an Editor and an Approver.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Task</th>
<th align="left">Reference</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>Editor requests the creation of a new GPO or an Approver creates a new GPO.</p></td>
